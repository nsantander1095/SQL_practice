# SQL Practice

## Preface
I already know a lot of SQL so this will just be a good place to take notes for things I'd like to remember.

## Beginner Notes
SQL - Structured Query Language

```CREATE TABLE``` - creates a new table

```INSERT INTO``` - adds a new row to a table

```SELECT``` - queries data from a table

```ALTER TABLE``` - changes an existing table

```UPDATE``` - edits a row in a table

```DELETE FROM``` - deletes row from a table
